# Building a property search engine with spatial search conditions

Note that in order to run this code you need to download a dataset of apartments and place it in the "data" folder.

Start by running the "preprocessing.Rmd" file, then the "search_engine.Rmd" file. 

If you already have the "apartments.csv" file in the "data" folder, you can skip the time-consuming preprocessing and go straight to the search engine.
